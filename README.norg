   - Download: {https://github.com/pysan3/nim_norg/releases}
   - API documentation: {https://pysan3.github.io/nim_norg/}

** Usage
*** Command
    - Usage: {usage.txt}
    -- `nim_norg help`

*** Example
    - Use `-i`, `-o` flags (`--input`, `--output`)
    @code bash
    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvim-neorg/norg-specs/main/1.0-specification.norg
    $ norganic json --input ./1.0-specifications.norg --output ./parsed.json
    $ nim_norg generate -i ./parsed.json -o out.norg
    $ nvim out.norg
    @end
    - Use `stdin`, `stdout`
    @code bash
    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvim-neorg/norg-specs/main/1.0-specification.norg
    $ norganic json --input ./1.0-specifications.norg | nim_norg generate > out.norg
    $ nvim out.norg
    @end

** Known Issues

*** File Linking
    It is very hard to distinguish what link pattern should be used.

    - (x) URL: `{https://xxx.example.com}`
    -- (x) URL with name: {https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/}[Neorg GitHub]
    - ( ) Norg files
    -- ( ) Relative to current file: `{:foo/bar:}` -> `foo/bar.norg`
    -- ( ) Absolute path: `{:/tmp/foo/bar:}` -> `/tmp/foo/bar.norg`. (Also works with `~/` = `$HOME/`)
    -- ( ) Relative to current workspace: `{:$/foo/bar:}` -> `~/Norg/Notes/foo/bar.norg`
    -- ( ) Relative to different workspace: `{:$work/foo/bar:}` -> `~/Norg/work/foo/bar.norg`
    - ( ) Usual files: `{/ /path/to/file}`
    - (x) Headings: {* Heading 1}
    -- (x) Any level heading: {# Heading 2}

    *AND YOU CAN COMBINE THEM*
    - ( ) `Heading 1` of `foo/bar.norg`: {:foo/bar:* Heading 1}
    - ( ) Line numbers: {:foo/bar:4}

*** `|example` Is Not Restored Correctly
    This is a problem in `norganic` / `Norg.jl`.
    - (x) I will make a PR later.
    -- (x) {https://github.com/Klafyvel/Norg.jl/issues/41}
    - ( ) He says he needs some help {https://github.com/Klafyvel/Norg.jl/issues/41#issuecomment-1784814268}[here].
    - (x) Auto convert `@code norg` -> `|example`

*** Softbreak Not Preserved
    When the original note (especially markdown) had softbreaks (single new
    line to format the document but does not mean a new paragraph), that new line does not
    get transferred to the generated file.

    - (x) fix softbreak
    - (x) Modifier chars (i.e. *bold*, /italic/, ...) cannot be escaped when they are used as a real symbol.

*** Markdown TODO Not Working
    According to `pandoc -f markdown -t json`, bullet list with todo (`- [ \]`) is treated as a simple
    `["-", " ", "[", " ", "]"]` which cannot be converted to norg style (`- ( \)`).

    - (x) Fix markdown style todo items

** Contribution
   Any contribution is welcome!! And don't hesitate to send me an issue.

** TODOs
   This was created for a proof of concept. Everything is duct-taped together.
   I really need to clean the code.
